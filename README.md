## 1.Heart Disease Price Prediction Project

In this project, I developed a machine learning model to predict heart disease prices. The workflow included exploratory data analysis (EDA), scaling, encoding, and data preprocessing steps to ensure the model's accuracy and reliability. The project aims to provide insights into pricing strategies for heart disease treatments.
